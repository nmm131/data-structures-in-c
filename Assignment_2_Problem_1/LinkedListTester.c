//
//  This is a simple demonstration of the singly linked list functions.
//  It demos the abilities to:
//      Make a linked list - uses call to LL_Init()
//      Add items to the front of the list - uses call to LL_AddToFront()
//      Add items to the end of the list - uses call to LL_AddToEnd()
//      Get whatever item is at the fron of the list, optionally deleting it
//          - uses call to LL_GetFront with option to delete or retain the data
//      Treat the list like an array, getting or an item by specifying the
//          index of the item (0 is the front) - uses call to LL_GetAtIndex()
//      Whenever we want to see how many items are inside the list, we call
//          LL_Length() to return the item count.
//  This code has been "overly documented" so that it serves as a learning
//  piece of code.  Take the time to read and undersatand it!

// we use printf from stdio.h
#include <stdio.h>
// we use the linked list, so include its functions that we can call
#include "LinkedList.h"
// we use UserData when we call the list functions
#include "UserData.h"

// PrintLL is a local function that we can call to print out a message (msg) and then
// the list contents (theLL).  So we can see how many things are allocated as we proceed,
// it will also print out the number of things allocated

// PrintLLitem is a local function that we can call to print out a message (msg) and
// a UserData item.  So we can see how many things are allocated as we proceed,
// it will also print out the number of things allocated

// we can see how the allocations are inceeasing or decreasing.
