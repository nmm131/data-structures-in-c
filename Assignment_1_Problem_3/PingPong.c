 Function: Ping
 Summary:
 Ping is responsible for logging its received value (val) and conditionally calling Pong.
 After logging the received input, it passes the information to Pong with the input
 value decremented by 1 if the input was positive.
 
 When the function returns, it provides an int with the decremented value
 *****************************************************/
int Ping (int val)
{
    // log the incoming value
    printf ("in Ping with value %d\n", val);
    // Make the call to Pong only if the decemented value has not gone negative
    if (--val >= 0)
        Pong(val);
    return val;
